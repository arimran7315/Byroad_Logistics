                        <h3>International transfer of personal data</h3>
                        <p>We may collect, transfer, and store your personal data in the united states and by our affiliates
                            in other countries where we operate. As a result, your personal data may be processed outside
                            the European Economic Area (EEA) and in countries that have not received an adequacy decision
                            from the European commission and may not provide the same level of data protection as the EEA.
                            In such cases, we will ensure that the recipient of your personal data provides an adequate
                            level of protection, for example, by entering into standard contractual clauses for data
                            transfer approved by the European commission (article 46 GDPR), or we will seek your prior
                            consent to such international data transfers.</p>
