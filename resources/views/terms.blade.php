                                as a final shipment condition report, especially in case of a dispute with the carrier.

                                regardless of the lighting or weather conditions at the time of inspection, will serve as
                                confirmation that customer received the shipment at destination in satisfactory condition
                                and that Byroad Logistic Inc. And the carrier will have no further responsibility.</li>
